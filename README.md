# Magnetic-Field-Modeling
Collections of scripts and functions for the generation of magnetic fields from axially uniformly magnetized cylindrical permanent magnets (or equivalently of axial solenoids) and of axially magnetized rings. This repository contains also few functions for the visualization of the field and to draw magnets.

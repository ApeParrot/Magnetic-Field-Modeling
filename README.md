# Magnetic-Field-Modeling

Collections of MATLAB scripts and functions for the design of cylindrically magnetized objects.

Capability of the functions present in the repository: 
1) Computation of **Magnetic Field** and **Magnetic Field Gradient** for *cylindrical* and *ring* permanent magnets with *arbitrary* and *uniform* magnetization (e.g., Axially and Diametrically magnetized cylinders as special cases), or equivalently of axial solenoids. These functions can be used for the computation of the Torques and Forces (Field and Field Gradient, respectively) applied by a permanent magnet cylinder to a magnetic dipole.
2) Computation of **Forces** and **Torques** between coaxial permanent magnets cylinders with axial or diametric magnetization.
3) Visualization functions for the magnetic field and field gradient.

Additional information on the models will be provided soon ...
